                        CHAPTER # 2
                 NETWORK TOPOLOGIES
TOPOLOGIES:
 A network topology is the arrangement of devices (nodes) and connections (links) in a computer network. It shows how computers, servers, and other devices are connected and how data flows between them. There are two main types of topologies: 
Physical Topology:
    The actual physical layout of cables and devices. 
Logical Topology:
 How data moves across the network, regardless of physical layout.

1. Peer to Peer
Point-to-point topology is a type of topology that works on the functionality of the sender and receiver. It is the simplest communication between two nodes, in which one is the sender and the other one is the receiver. Point-to-Point provides high bandwidth.

                                 Fig 1.1
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 
This topology works as an interlink within only 2 pcs, A single cable line is used to connect nodes with each other. 
Nodes:Links:IP Addresses:PC0Copper Cross over192.168.10.6PC2Copper Cross over192.168.10.5
1.1 Assigning IP Addresses:
Step 1: Click on the PC 
        
                                      Fig 1.1.1
                                      
A window will open. 
● Go to the config tab
● Select FastEthernet0 
                                      Fig 1.1.2
● Add IP4 Address
● And make sure all devices have unique ip addresses.

                             Fig 1.1.3
Step 2: Checking Connectivity
● PING: USE PING COMMAND TO CHECK CONNECTIVITY 
                      
                                     Fig 1.1.4
● For that Go to the Desktop tab
● select command prompt and write PING IP address. e.g. to connect PC0 to PC1 write PING 192.168.10.02.

           Fig 1.1.5




2. RING:
In a Ring Topology, it forms a ring connecting devices with exactly two neighboring devices. A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with many nodes, because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes, then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node. Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network. 

In-Ring Topology, the Token Ring Passing protocol is used by the workstations to transmit the data where, Token passing is a network access method in which a token is passed from one node to another node & Token is a frame that circulates around the network.

          Fig 2.1
          
          
This network represents a Ring Topology, where each switch is connected to two neighboring switches, forming a closed loop. Each PC acts as a node connected to one switch in the ring or you can say In ring topology, each node is connected to every other node ensuring the connections of the devices in a closed loop.

NodesLinksConnected with Ip AddressesPC3ST wireS7192.168.10.2PC4ST wireS6192.168.10.1PC5ST wireS5192.168.10.3Laptop 1ST wireS8192.168.10.4Switch 5ST & CTS7, S8, PC5N/ASwitch 6ST & CTS7, S8, PC4N/ASwitch 7ST & CTS5, S6, PC3N/ASwitch 8ST & CTS6, S5, Laptop 1N/A
















   3. BUS 
Bus Topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to a single cable. It is bi-directional. It is a multi-point connection and a non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes.


Fig 3.1
A bus is linear type of interconnected device, in which each node is connected through a single wire that behaves as the backbone of the entire network. Thus, all the information traveled in this network will be communicating unidirectionally.

The theoretical setup of buses cannot be structured in real life, because a PC can be connected only through one wire and continuing the network is not possible this way







4. STAR:
In Star Topology, all the devices are connected to a single central nod through a cable. This hub is the central node and all other nodes are connected to the central node.

Fig 4.1
The star Topology consists of nodes connected centrally through a HUB/ Switch.
The structure of this network topology is like a star and usually has 5 nodes but that can be scaled according to the usage. 




CHAPTER # 3
INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK DEVICES

Network devices are fundamental hardware components in computer networking that operate across different layers of the OSI and TCP/IP models. They facilitate data transmission, regulate traffic flow, provide interconnectivity between heterogeneous networks, and enforce security policies.
 Functions of Network Devices 
● Enable communication by transmitting and receiving data between devices. 
● Allow devices to connect to networks efficiently and securely. 
● Improve network performance by reducing congestion and managing traffic. 
● Provide security by controlling access and preventing unauthorized activities. 
● Extend network coverage and solve signal loss or attenuation problems. 

Types of networking devices:

1. Repeater:


A repeater is signal reviving device, through which the dead signals are regenerated, it just captures the weak signal and generates strong signals.

                Fig 1.1

Fig 1.2
2. Hub
      
  A Hub is small area network device that is used to                                        connect nodes in a small network, it has several ports that can connect a small number of nodes in a small geographical area.                                  

Fig 2.1

3. Bridge

A bridge behaves as the connector between two Local Area Networks. 
A bridge behaves as a connection between Two Local Area Networks so that each can communicate with the other.
   
   Fig 3.1
                 
                                     Fig 3.2









4. Switch
A switch is a most used network device that is used to connect devices inside a Local Area Network. The purpose of this device is to connect as many nodes as needed in a limited geographical area, maintaining features like security, Data Protection etc.



Fig 4.1

                                      Fig 4.2
                       
                                        Fig 4.3
5. Router[1]
A router is routing device that is used to connect Multiple Local Area Networks to connect and able to communicate within. 
A router can connect many LANs thus creating a WAN.


Fig 5.1
Functions of a Router
● Forwarding: Receives packets, examines headers, and forwards them to the correct output port.
● Routing: Determines the optimal path for packets using routing tables and algorithms.
● Network Address Translation (NAT): Translates private IPs to a public IP for Internet access.
● Security: Supports firewalls and other security measures.
● VPN Connectivity: Provides secure remote access to networks.
● Bandwidth Management: Controls data flow to prevent congestion.
● Monitoring & Diagnostics: Tracks traffic and helps troubleshoot network issues.

                        CHAPTER # 4
  VLAN
VLAN
In Cisco Packet Tracer, a VLAN (Virtual LAN) lets you split one physical switch into multiple logical networks. Instead of buying separate switches for departments like Sales, HR, or IT, you use one switch and logically isolate their traffic. Devices in one VLAN (e.g., Sales) cannot see or interact with devices in another VLAN (e.g., HR) unless you add routing.
            
            
1. Why VLANs are used
● Broadcast Control:
Without VLANs, every broadcast hits every device on the switch. VLANs break the network into smaller broadcast domains, keeping unnecessary traffic contained.
● Security and Isolation:
Sensitive traffic stays separated. For example, student devices and admin devices run on the same hardware but are logically isolated.
● Organization:
Devices are grouped by purpose instead of physical location. An HR user on the 1st floor and another on the 3rd floor can still belong to the same VLAN with the same policies.


The following image shows how a switch forwards broadcast messages when it has two VLANs.
                        
                                  Fig 1.1
                                  
                                  
                                  
                                  
                                  
                                  
                                  
2. Basic setup in Packet Tracer
        
        Fig 2.1
Step 1: 
● After placing PCs and switches, assign IP addresses by clicking each PC → IP Configuration → IPv4.
● Then move to the switch CLI:
> enable
# no shutdown
# exit	
                                        Fig 2.2
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
     Step 2:
● configure the interface you're using. Example for FastEthernet 0/1:
Switch(config)# interface fa0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10
# exit
                                        Fig 2.3
  Step 3: Common VLAN commands
Create a VLAN:
Switch(config)# vlan 10
Switch(config-vlan)# name Sales
Fig 2.4
Assign a port as an access port for that VLAN:
Switch(config)# interface fa0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10
                                        Fig 2.5

Switch(config-vlan)#name Sales
Switch(config-vlan)#exit
●  Note: use these commands to create all Vlans.

Fig 1.1.1


●        Naming the Vlan 20 as HR
 
Naming the vlan 30 as IT




     Finally name the Vlan 40 as Finance.

Step 3: Assigning Switch Ports to a VLAN.

In this step, FastEthernet port 0/1 is configured as an access port and assigned to VLAN 10. This ensures that the PC connected to this port becomes part of the Sales VLAN.


In this step, FastEthernet port 0/2 is configured as an access port and assigned to VLAN 10. This ensures that the PC connected to this port becomes part of the Sales VLAN.

Using the range code, we assign both ports to vlan 20 at once.

same assigning the fa0/5 and fa0/6 to 
vlan 30.


And same goes for here assigning fa0/7 and 0/8 to vlan 40














               CHAPTER # 5:
                       OSI Layers


1. OSI MODEL: Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation Analysis
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network. OSI Model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The OSI Model consists of 7 layers, and each layer has specific functions and responsibilities. This layered approach makes it easier for different devices and technologies to work together.

3. OSI MODEL - LAYERS
  3.1 Layer 7: Application Layer:
At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, we find the Application Layer which is implemented by the network applications. These applications produce data to be transferred over the network.
● This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access the network and for displaying the received information to the user.
● Protocols used in the Application layer are SMTP, FTP, DNS, etc.
     
                                   Fig 3.1
3.2 Layer 6: Presentation Layer
The Presentation Layer is also called the Translation Layer. The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network. Protocols used in the Presentation Layer are TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer).JPEG, MPEG, GIF, are standards or formats used for encoding data, which is part of the presentation layer's role.
                 
                 Fig 3.2
3.3 Layer 5: Session Layer
Session Layer in the OSI Model is responsible for the establishment of connections, management of connections, and termination of sessions between two devices. It also provides authentication and security. Protocols used in the Session Layer are NetBIOS, PPTP.
        
                 Fig 3.3

3.4 Layer 4: Transport Layer:
The Transport Layer provides services to the application layer and takes services from the network layer. The data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments. It is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of the complete message.
           
                 Fig 3.4
3.5 Layer 3: Network Layer
The Network Layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. It also takes care of packet routing, i.e. selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from the number of routes available.
● The sender and receiver's IP address are placed in the header by the network layer. Segment in the Network layer is referred to as Packet.
● Network layer is implemented by networking devices such as routers and switches.
                    
                 Fig 3.5

3.6 Layer 2: Data Link Layer
The data link layer is responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the message. The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another, over the physical layer.
● When a packet arrives in a network, it is the responsibility of the DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC address.
● Packet in the Data Link layer is referred to as Frame. Switches and Bridges are common Data Link Layer devices.
                 
                 Fig 3.6

3.7 Layer 1: Physical Layer: 
The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the Physical Layer. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices. The physical layer contains information in the form of bits.
● Physical Layer is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next.
● When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put the frame back together.
           
                 Fig 3.7



Example:
Identifying Layer 3: The Routing and Addressing Layer
● Scenario:
PC1 (192.168.1.11) sends an ICMP Echo Request (Ping) to SRV1 (192.168.1.100).
● Observation Point: PC1 (The Source)
● Encapsulation:
 As the ICMP data leaves the Transport Layer (Layer 4), it is passed down to the Network Layer (Layer 3).
● PDU Name:
 The Layer 3 Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is now called a Packet. 
Key Action: PC1 adds an IP Header to the data. You can inspect this header in the "Outbound PDU Details" window.
● Stimulation View

● Stimulation Panel
When you click on the colored PDU envelope at each hop (PC1, Switch, Server), the "PDU Information" window appears. This window is split into three main sections: OSI Model, Inbound PDU Details, and Outbound PDU Details. 
● PDU Information at Device: Server 1 
When the PDU arrives at the Server, it's a moment of truth. The Server must confirm that the data is for it and then process the request. It does this by moving the data up the OSI stack, removing the headers one by one.

Types of Routers
Below, we have discussed different types of routers that are being used for various purposes in almost every industry.
1. Wireless Router
Wireless routers are devices that are mainly used to connect a computer to the internet modem and make the network available without wires. This is where several devices, for example, smart phones, laptops, tablets. Smart TVs, etc., can access the Internet without wires.
Wireless routers operate through the use of radio signals. They are simple to install and suitable for residential, commercial or any area where individuals employ a range of wireless devices.
Wireless routers that are being produced today can handle high speeds, and you also get options such as dual-band or tri-band routers that help in getting less interference. It makes communication easy and offers better solutions for all your internet-related issues.
2. Core Router
A core router is defined as extremely valuable equipment that is applied in big networks, like Internet providers or large companies. Its primary function is to guide the flow of data frames inside or across a network at a very fast pace. Unlike traditional routers, core routers are purposely built to deal with large traffic and are implemented with high speed.
It links different parts of a network and helps communication between those two parts. Hubs or core routers usually do not transmit Wi-Fi signals; they are just responsible for controlling the traffic between network centers. These routers support thousands of connections and, therefore, are best suited for large networking environments such as data centers and telecom service providers.
3. Edge Router
Next in the list of types of routers is Edge Router. An edge router is a device that provides communication between internal networks, including business or home networks, and external networks or the internet. It is situated at the periphery of a network and performs data entry into and out of a network.
Edge routers are also used to determine by which path the data is to be transferred from your private network to other public networks. Edge routers have Firewalls and VPN capabilities as well as provide you with the protection from external threats to your network.
Examples of edge routers are CISCO ISR, MikroTik EdgeRouter, Juniper MX Series and Ubiquiti EdgeRouter. These devices are most used by businesses and ISPs to proficiently manage flow at the network edge.
4. SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) Router
A SOHO router is specifically intended for use in small offices or home offices. It is equipped with the internet as well as intended and designed networking solutions for small settings better known as office environments. These routers are not very complicated and are all in one device that can act as standard routers, provide wireless connectivity and even basic security features in one device.
SOHO routers are perfectly suitable for linking a couple of devices, starting from computers, printers and smartphones to the internet. They also have capabilities to provide Wi-Fi, port forwarding and firewall protection to make a connection safe and stable.
Some of the examples of the SOHO routers are TP-Link Archer Series, Netgear Nighthawk Series, ASUS RT Series and Linksys EA Series. Although these devices are cheap, they are suitable for those people who require fundamental solutions to networking, focusing on small-scale operations.
5. Virtual Router
A virtual router is a router that executes the physical features of a router but is defined in a virtual platform. It can be used in cloud computing, virtualized computing networks, or any other network that requires flexibility and scalability.
One can assign duties such as managing the flow of traffic in the network, controlling the IP addresses, and even management of secure connections. Most importantly, it does not require the physical routers. It is easy to install, thus convenient for businesses which are planning to cut costs and conserve space.
Some of the virtual routers include Cisco Cloud Services Router (CSR 1000V),
